        <p>We build software for an unpredictable world. Requirements shift, priorities pivot, and technologies evolve.
          The single most crucial trait our code and our processes can possess isn't raw performance (though that's
          nice!) – it's <strong>flexibility</strong>.</p>
        <p>Flexibility isn't about building everything upfront. It's about building intelligently so change isn't a
          crisis. It means:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Code that Bends, Doesn't Break:</strong> Writing modular, well-encapsulated components (think
              SOLID principles!) means changing one part doesn't send shockwaves through the entire system. Refactoring
              becomes feasible, not frightening.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Tests as Your Safety Net:</strong> A solid suite of automated tests (unit, integration) isn't
              just about catching bugs; it's the foundation of fearless change. They give you the confidence to adapt
              and improve without breaking existing functionality.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Architecture with Room to Grow:</strong> Designing with clear boundaries and well-defined
              interfaces creates "seams" where new features or technologies can be slotted in later without a complete
              rewrite. Avoid the "Big Ball of Mud."</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Embracing Uncertainty (Pragmatically):</strong> YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) isn't laziness;
              it's wisdom. Over-engineering for hypothetical futures often creates rigidity. Solve today's problems
              well, and design so solving tomorrow's problems is possible.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>The Mindset Shift:</strong> Flexibility starts between our ears. It's the willingness to revisit
              decisions, challenge assumptions, learn new tools when they offer real value, and prioritize "changeable"
              over "clever."</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Flexibility != Complexity:</strong> True flexibility often emerges from <strong>simplicity</strong>
          and <strong>clarity</strong>. The easiest code to change is code that's easy to understand. </p>
        <p><strong>Why Bother?</strong> Because inflexible software becomes legacy software faster. Flexible software
          survives, adapts, and delivers value longer. It saves time, money, and sanity.</p>

        <p><strong>Build to adapt. Your future self (and your team) will thank you.</strong></p>
